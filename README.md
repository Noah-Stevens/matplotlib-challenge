# matplotlib-challenge
Module 5 Assignment

This challenge deals with surveing mock dta for pharmaceutical tests with various drugs being used on mice.

In this submission I created various plots in both matplotlib and pandas to showcase many relationships in the data.

Types of plots/graphs of what was created are: Bar Chart, Pie + Donut Chart, Scatter Plot + Regression, etc.

Pre and post class reviews of the challenge from Professor Booth helped immensely, alongside checking in with chatgpt and a few matplotlib cheatsheets for more advanced features.

Thanks for reading!! :))
